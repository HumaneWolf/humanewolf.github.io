## TruckersMP

TruckersMP is a multiplayer modification for the games Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, as well as the community surrounding it, which now has more than 2 000 000 members and a staff team that is more than 100 (wo)men strong.

I am one of the developers creating and maintaining the TruckersMP website, API, game servers, and other systems. The website is built with PHP and the Laravel framework, and uses MySQL and Redis for storage. We are also using and administrating multiple other softwares and system to aid us in operations and in development.

The website and API are responsible for most communication and storage. It handles logins, keeps track of bans, allows communication with staff, etc. Amonst other things, I implemented an OAuth2 server into our website (using [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport)), and I implemented our recruitment system, which allows management to build their own recruitment forms, templates, and organizes applications for them.

I also do occasional work on the mod itself and the game servers, which are written in C++. For example, I implemented code to make the game server more aware of which rank a staff member has, so it can list their actual title. In doing that, I changed some code communicating with our API, changed network code to allow the server to send the data to the client, and changed the client to read and display said data.

We additionally have a variety of other systems, both written by us and open source tools, which use a variety of languages.
